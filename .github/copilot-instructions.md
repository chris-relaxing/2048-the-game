# 2048 Game Project

This is a 2048 game implementation with the following key files:

## Core Files
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure with grid layout
- `styles.css` - CSS styling and animations
- `game.js` - Game logic and mechanics

## File Structure
All files are located in `/workspaces/php-dev-container/2048-the-game/`

## Dependencies
- jQuery 3.3.1 (jquery-3.3.1.min.js)

## Notes
- Uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and animations
- Grid-based layout with divs labeled a-p
- Gameboard is a 4x4 array

## Coding Style Rules
1. Don't unnecessarily remove comments or console.logs to clean up the code
2. When making a new line, don't add whitespace to it. The blank line should be completely empty
